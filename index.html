<h2 style = "padding-left: 25px;">What does this analysis tell us?</h2>
<div class = "content">
<p>This analysis summarises some of the published data on Coronavirus (Covid-19). It shows changes in confirmed cases over time as well as the mortality related to Covid-19.</p>
<p>This is primarily for the Sussex Local Authorities (Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, and West Sussex), but it also covers the 19 UTLAs in the South East region of England.</p>

<p>There are lots of stories to tell with the data, but it should be noted that<b> our understanding is evolving daily </b> as new information is received and as the data is revised. The box below shows a few important things to remember whilst exploring this analyses.</p>
<ul class='summary'>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>What we know about the spread of Covid-19 is a reflection of testing suspected cases.</li>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>Data on the death toll of Covid-19 comes from several different sources, each offering different perspectives as well as having different caveats. These should be considered carefully.</li>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>There are frequent changes in who are counted in statistics as well as changes in populations being tested for Covid-19 as capacity increases over time. Spikes in confirmed cases and deaths can be the result of virus spread as well as the way information is recorded.</li>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>Over time, new data will be added that will be more accurate and offer deeper understanding of the impact of Covid-19 on health and wellbeing.</li>

<h2 style = "padding-left: 25px;">Confirmed cases</h2>
<div class = 'content'  id = 'content_size'>
<!-- <p id = 'unconfirmed_cases_count'></p> -->
<p>Data are back dated and revised such that every lab-confirmed case is attributed to the date at which the specimin was taken, which means the outbreak starts on different dates for different areas. The first specimins for a confirmed Covid-19 infection were taken on Janurary 30th 2020.</p>
<p id = 'data_recency'></p>

<p>The first table and visualisation shows the most recently recorded confirmed cases and the number of new confirmed cases by day. It is ordered by total number (cumulative) of confirmed cases to date with the highest number of confirmed cases at the top. You can toggle between viewing the coloured tiles as actual confirmed cases or as confirmed cases per 100,000 population (crude, all age population as at 2018). </p>
<p><font color = 'red'>The cumulative cases are taken from the most recently available date, although number of confirmed cases in a single day (a proxy for new cases) is taken from six days prior (latest complete date).</font></p>
</div>

<div class = 'right-sidebar'>
  <p class = 'side'>The areas across the South East have vast differences in population sizes.</p>
  <p class = 'side'>The smallest area in terms of population,  Bracknell Forest, is estimated to be home for around 121,600 residents whilst Kent, with the biggest population, is estimated to be home for almost 13 times Bracknell Forest's population with around 1,568,600 people estimated to live there.</p>
  <p class = 'side'>Given the differences in population, you might naturally expect there to be more cases in one area than another. Viewing the cases per 100,000 allows you to compare across areas as if they had the same population size.</p>

<h3 style = 'padding-left: 25px;'>A note on testing and data</h3>
<div class = 'content'>
<ul class = 'summary'>
<li class = 'list_summary'>The current (April) strategy has largely been to prioritise testing among those patients with suspected Covid-19 symptoms in intensive care units within hospitals, then in isolated cluster outbreak settings such as care homes as well as a small sample of general practices carrying out random testing for surveillance purposes (<a href = 'https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1222'>BMJ, 2020</a>).</li>
<li class = 'list_summary'>As capacity increases, more and more healthcare workers as well as other keyworkers are being prioritised for testing in what has been termed 'Pillar 2' testing, which includes testing from commercial partners. From 29th April 2020, anyone aged over 65 as well as anyone who must leave their home to go to work will be able to have a swab test.</li>
<li class = 'list_summary'>Beyond this, the government is planning to expand diagnostics to antibody testing to confirm that a person has had the virus and is therefore likely to be immune from catching it again. See <a href = 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-testing-programmes/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-our-testing-programmes'>Government testing plans April 6th 2020</a> for more details.</li>
<br>
<li class = 'list_summary'>From the 14th April, PHE changed the method of reporting to show confirmed cases by the date at which the specimin for testing was taken. The first positive specimen date is used and duplicate tests for the same patient are removed. Whilst this method more accurately tracks the dates at which people are known to be infected, it may look like cases on the most recent days (which are still being reported daily) are sloping off (getting smaller). <b>This is not the case, it is simply that the most recent testing results may take several days to be reported.</b> PHE suggest that data for the most recent five days should be treated with caution and considered 'incomplete'.</li>

<p class = 'side'>Whilst comparing rates per 100,000 helps to standardise the total population size, it does not take into account different demographics of the populations in each area (e.g. the age and sex structure of a population). Data on the confirmed cases by age and sex, particularly at sub-national level, is currently unavailable. When and if these data become available, the figures will be updated to include age-sex standardised rates.</p>
<p class = 'side'>Population denominators are taken from the mid-year estimates for 2018 published by the <a href = 'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland'>Office for National Statistics (ONS)</a>.</p>
<p class = 'side'>Rates are rounded to the nearest whole number (case). It should be noted that whilst cases are relatively low in some areas, rates may not be robust and in many cases may hover around zero for some time, although this does not necessarily mean zero cases.</p>

<div class="main" id = 'loglinear_timeseries'>
<h3 style = 'padding-left:25px;'>Cumulative cases over time from a different perspective</h3>
<div class = 'content'>
<p>So far, we have compared areas over time using counts and rates. These have shown vast differences across areas, and particularly highlighted that some local areas might be much further along their individual outbreaks than others. Indeed, we see that some areas such as Kent are recording their 2,000th confirmed case whilst the 50th case is being reported on the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>As some areas record their first few confirmed cases on different days, we have redrawn the x axis (along the bottom from left to right) on the next figure to count the number of days since case number 10. By doing this, you pull all of the trajectories to start at the same point on the figure and they can be compared with other areas on this basis. Starting on case number 10, rather than case number 1, means that the trajectories are a little more established and potentially showing transmission within an area as opposed to single cases coming into the area.</p>
<p>In addition, we have redrawn the y (vertical) axis to show the cumulative number of confirmed cases on a logarithmic scale (briefly explained on the right) to particularly highlight changes in growth (speeding up or slowing down) of infections. You can toggle between loglinear and linear scales to consider what each representation does to the data and trends.</p>
<p>The figure shows all of the South East region Local Authority areas on one figure (South East region and England have been excluded to make it easier to see each local area). You can hover over an area with you mouse pointer to find out more or choose an area from the drop down menu to highlight without hovering.</p>

  <p class = 'side'>Much like the importance of considering both actual cases and cases per 100,000, it is also useful to view the data from both a linear and a logarithmic scale.</p>
  <p class = 'side'>The log scale also helps us to visualise exponential growth and doubling over time. A straight line with a steep slope indicates that the diagnosed cases will double in a short period of time whereas a line with a flatter slope suggests that the cases are not growing as quickly and will take much longer to double.</p>

<h4>Other measures of Covid-19 spread</h4>
<p>The data presented so far has been based on confirmed cases of Covid-19. The confirmed cases are only a representation of the testing strategy and currently only show test results for patients in hospital as well as 'frontline' healthcare workers. <b>There will be many undiagnosed cases in the community (outside of hospital), in carehomes, and in other settings (such as prisons).</b></p>
<p>Until a robust community testing capability is realised, it is impossible to define the true spread of Covid-19. However, there are some other data sources and measures that can help to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>Symptom tracker applications such as the 'COVID Symptom Tracker' by researchers at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas' Hospitals, and ZOE Global ltd. This allows users to enter how they are physically feeling daily along with information on their sex, age, ethnicity, and first part of their postcode. Users can say if they are feeling well and have no symptoms or to indicate that they are symptomatic. Whilst much of this detailed data is not publicly available, it is possible to see at lower tier local authority level, the proportion of users who report at least some symptoms of the Covid-19 virus. In the UK (as at 18th April), there were 462,672 people aged 20-69 who reported currently having symptoms of the virus. Of course, not all those with symptoms will use the application, and the local figures do not include those under the age of 20 or over the age of 69.</p>
<p>Another source of information comes from the the NHS 111 symptom reporting pathways and 111 online. This shows, at the level of Clinical Commissioning Groups (which are largely coterminous with local authority boundaries through aggregation), the number of pathway triages and online assessments in which a user reports Covid-19 symptoms. Data include assessments by sex and broad age group (0-18, 19-69, and 70-120 years) of the user. There are many caveats around this, including that the data are not counts of people but rather assessments, people with symptoms might not use this or might use it multiple times over the course of their symptoms (and maybe not at the start of their symptoms). People are encouraged NOT to call NHS 111 to report Covid-19 symptoms unless they are worried but are asked to complete an NHS 111 online triage assessment. However, this data may give some indication of the symptom reporting locally.</p>
<p><font color = 'red'>Both the COVID Symptom Tracker, and NHS triage data, are for reporting of symptoms and they are not in anyway representative of confirmed cases of Covid-19.</font></p>

<div class="main" id = 'deaths_summary'>
<h2 style = 'padding-left:25px;'>Mortality</h2>

<div class ='content'>
<p>This section focuses on the burden of Covid-19 in terms of the number of lives lost as a result of the virus.</p>
<p>When a person dies, their death is certified and registered formally with the registry office for the local authority district in which the person lived. If a person dies in hospital deaths, their death is registered with the district office in which the hospital is located. A death should be registered within five days of the death occurring, and upon the issue of a medical certificate detailing the cause or causes of death although registration can be delayed if the death has been reported to the coroner and an investigation or inquest is required.</p>
<p>These registration processes naturally take time and so NHS England, and now the Care Quality Commission, have begun reporting the number of deaths they have been notified as soon as it is practicably possible to support the response to Covid-19.</p>
<p>There are at least three sources of data for understanding the number of Covid-19 deaths. A summary of the key differences in the three sources is given in the table below.</p>

<p>The national figures covering all settings are reported daily. However, to understand mortality at a local level using publicly available data we have to look at the individual settings and for deaths occuring outside of hospital, there is some time delay in reporting. There are more timely figures for hospital deaths, which are explored further down in the analysis, but these are reported at Acute Hospital Trust and this is not always coterminous with residential populations of local authorities.</p>

<p>The ONS has begun publishing weekly data at lower tier local authority for the number of deaths occurring in each week in the 2020 calendar year. From 31 March 2020 these figures also show the number of deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19), based on any mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate. These are aggregated to upper tier local authority for this analysis.</p>
