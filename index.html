<h2 style = "padding-left: 25px;">What does this analysis tell us?</h2>
<div class = "content">
<p>This analysis summarises some of the published data on Coronavirus (Covid-19). It shows changes in confirmed cases over time as well as the mortality related to Covid-19.</p>
<p>This is primarily for the Sussex Local Authorities (Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, and West Sussex), but it also covers the 19 UTLAs in the South East region of England.</p>

<p>There are lots of stories to tell with the data, but it should be noted that<b> our understanding is evolving daily </b> as new information is received and as the data is revised. The box below shows a few important things to remember whilst exploring this analyses.</p>
<ul class='summary'>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>What we know about the spread of Covid-19 is a reflection of testing suspected cases.</li>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>Data on the death toll of Covid-19 comes from several different sources, each offering different perspectives as well as having different caveats. These should be considered carefully.</li>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>There are frequent changes to who are counted in statistics as well as changes in populations being tested for Covid-19 as capacity increases over time. Spikes in confirmed cases and deaths can be the result of virus spread as well as the way information is recorded.</li>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>Over time, new data will be added that will be more accurate and offer deeper understanding of the impact of Covid-19 on health and wellbeing.</li>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>As yet, there are no public data detailing the number of tests conducted at a local level.</li>

<div class = 'content'  id = 'content_size'>
<!-- <p id = 'unconfirmed_cases_count'></p> -->
<p>Data are back dated and revised such that every lab-confirmed case is attributed to the date at which the specimen was taken, which means the outbreak starts on different dates for different areas. The first specimens for a confirmed Covid-19 infection were taken on January 30th 2020.</p>
<p id = 'data_recency'></p>

<p>The first table and visualisation shows the most recently recorded confirmed cases and the number of new confirmed cases by day from pillar 1 (NHS and PHE laboratories) and pillar 2 (commercial testing) combined. It is ordered by total number (cumulative) of confirmed cases to date with the highest number of confirmed cases at the top. You can toggle between viewing the coloured tiles as actual confirmed cases or as confirmed cases per 100,000 population (crude, all age population as at 2018). </p>
<p><font color = 'red'>The cumulative cases are taken from the most recently available date, although number of confirmed cases in a single day (a proxy for new cases) is taken from six days prior (latest complete date). Given the differences in population, you might naturally expect there to be more cases in one area than another. Viewing the cases per 100,000 allows you to compare across areas as if they had the same population size.</font></p>
</div>

<div class = 'right-sidebar'>
  <p class = 'side'>The areas across the South East have vast differences in population sizes.</p>
  <p class = 'side'>The smallest area in terms of population,  Bracknell Forest, is estimated to be home for around 121,600 residents whilst Kent, with the biggest population, is estimated to be home for almost 13 times Bracknell Forest's population with around 1,568,600 people estimated to live there.</p>

<h4>Daily case changes and initial peaks</h4>
<p>The figure below shows the daily confirmed cases of Covid-19 over time by area (showing Sussex areas combined by default). The line represents the rolling average number of new cases confirmed in the previous seven days. You can change the area using the drop down menu. As with other figures in this analyses, the last five days of data are greyed out and should be treated as incomplete.</p>
<p>The figure includes key dates when changes to testing capacity and eligibility were announced. These are adapted from The Health Foundation <a href = 'https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker'>Covid-19 Policy Tracker</a>.</p>

<p>The figures for most areas in the region generally show a pattern of a single peak in new cases, illustrated by the rolling average line, although for some areas such as Southampton and Windsor and Maidenhead there is much more fluctuation and less of a pronounced single spike in confirmed cases.</p>
<p id = 'sussex_peaks'></p>
<p>It is useful to reiterate caution when considering changes in daily cases over time, as these are confirmed cases based on testing strategies and changes in capacity. More people are now able to be tested than in the first few weeks of the pandemic, when only hospital inpatients were tested, so new cases may be higher as a result of more people being tested. This ultimately means that the benefit of exploring daily cases will be realised only once a consistent number of tests are conducted each day. At the moment, details on local testing numbers are unavailable but this information will also strengthen our understanding of the true spread of Covid-19 and any local outbreaks.</p>

<h3 style="padding-left:25px;">Suspected and confirmed Covid-19 outbreaks in care home settings</h3>
<div class = "content">
<p>Care homes have been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and as at May 15th deaths in these settings accounted for around one in four Covid-19 deaths nationally and almost half of deaths across Sussex (see section on <a href = '#selected_m3_title'>mortality in this analysis)</a>.</p>
<p>Public Health England have begun publishing the number of care homes where a suspected or confirmed outbreak of Covid-19 has been reported to Public Health England each week from the beginning of March 2020 and this is updated every Thursday for the previous week (counted as Monday to Sunday).</p>

<p>The data release includes the number of CQC registered care homes in the area and a percentage value of care homes reporting a suspected or confirmed outbreak of COVID-19. However, areas such as rehabilitation units and assisted living units are not required to register with the CQC and so are may not be included in the denominator for the percentage value. The true denominator (all potential care homes and rehabilitation settings) is unknown but will likely be similar to the number registered with the CQC (which is shown as a dashed line on the figure).</p>
<p>You can choose a different area below using the drop down menu.</p>

<div class = 'content'>
<ul class = 'summary'>
<li class = 'list_summary'>The initial testing strategy was to prioritise testing among those patients with suspected Covid-19 symptoms in intensive care units within hospitals, then in isolated cluster outbreak settings such as care homes as well as a small sample of general practices carrying out random testing for surveillance purposes (<a href = 'https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1222'>BMJ, 2020</a>).</li>
<li class = 'list_summary'>As capacity increased, more and more healthcare workers as well as other keyworkers were prioritised for testing in what has been termed 'pillar 2' testing, which includes testing from commercial partners. From 23rd April, all symptomatic essential workers and members of thier households were included in the eligibility criteria and from the 28th April anyone aged 65 and over who must leave their home to go to work could access a test.</li>
<li class = 'list_summary'><b>From 27th May 2020, anyone with one or more symptoms is be able to have a Covid-19 test.</b></li>
<li class = 'list_summary'>Beyond this, the government is planning to expand diagnostics to antibody testing to confirm that a person has had the virus and is therefore likely to be immune from catching it again.

<br>
<li class = 'list_summary'>From the 14th April, PHE changed the method of reporting to show confirmed cases by the date at which the specimen for testing was taken. The first positive specimen date is used and duplicate tests for the same patient are removed. Whilst this method more accurately tracks the dates at which people are known to be infected, it may look like cases on the most recent days (which are still being reported daily) are sloping off (getting smaller). <b>This is not necessarily the case, it is simply that the most recent testing results may take several days to be reported.</b> PHE suggest that data for the most recent five days should be treated with caution and considered 'incomplete'.</li>

<div class = 'content'>
<p>So far, we have compared areas over time using counts and rates. These have shown vast differences across areas, and particularly highlighted that some local areas might be much further along their individual outbreaks than others. Indeed, we see that some areas such as Kent are recording their 2,000th confirmed case whilst the 50th case is being reported on the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>As some areas record their first few confirmed cases on different days, we have redrawn the x axis (along the bottom from left to right) on the next figure to count the number of days since case number 10. By doing this, you pull all of the trajectories to start at the same point on the figure and they can be compared with other areas on this basis. Starting on case number 10, rather than case number 1, means that the trajectories are a little more established and potentially showing transmission within an area as opposed to single cases coming into the area.</p>
<p>In addition, we have redrawn the y (vertical) axis to show the cumulative number of confirmed cases on a logarithmic scale (briefly explained on the right) to particularly highlight changes in growth (speeding up or slowing down) of infections. You can toggle between loglinear and linear scales to consider what each representation does to the data and trends.</p>

<h4>Measuring the true spread of Covid-19 spread</h4>
<p>The data presented so far has been based on confirmed cases of Covid-19. As alluded to in the last section, confirmed cases are only a representation of the testing strategy and until recently showed test results for patients in hospital as well as frontline healthcare workers. As at May 2020, there is capacity for 100,000 tests per day and anyone aged 5 and other with symptoms is now eligible for testing.</p>
<p>Until a robust community testing capability is realised, it is impossible to define the true spread of Covid-19. However, there are some other data sources and measures that can help to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>Symptom tracker applications such as the 'COVID Symptom Tracker' by researchers at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas' Hospitals, and ZOE Global ltd. This allows users to enter how they are physically feeling daily along with information on their sex, age, ethnicity, and first part of their postcode. Users can say if they are feeling well and have no symptoms or to indicate that they are symptomatic. Whilst much of this detailed data is not publicly available, it is possible to see at lower tier local authority level, the proportion of users who report at least some symptoms of the Covid-19 virus. In the UK (as at 19th May), there were 252,629 people aged 20-69 who reported currently having symptoms of the virus, this is down by more than 200,000 people compared to the month before (462,672 people as at 18th April). Of course, more people are able to have swab testing now to confirm symptoms and may cease reporting symptoms following a negative test result. More generally, not all those with symptoms will use the application, and the local figures do not include those under the age of 20 or over the age of 69.</p>
<p>Another source of information comes from the the NHS 111 symptom reporting pathways and 111 online. This shows, at the level of Clinical Commissioning Groups (which are largely coterminous with local authority boundaries through aggregation), the number of pathway triages and online assessments in which a user reports Covid-19 symptoms. Data include assessments by sex and broad age group (0-18, 19-69, and 70-120 years) of the user. There are many caveats around this, including that the data are not counts of people but rather assessments, people with symptoms might not use this or might use it multiple times over the course of their symptoms (and maybe not at the start of their symptoms). People are encouraged NOT to call NHS 111 to report Covid-19 symptoms unless they are worried but are asked to complete an NHS 111 online triage assessment. However, this data may give some indication of the symptom reporting locally.</p>
<p><font color = 'red'>Both the COVID Symptom Tracker, and NHS triage data, are for reporting of symptoms and they are not in anyway representative of confirmed cases of Covid-19.</font></p>

<h2 style = 'padding-left:25px;'>Mortality</h2>

<div class ='content'>
<p>This section focuses on the burden of Covid-19 in terms of the number of lives lost as a result of the virus.</p>
<p>When a person dies, their death is certified and registered formally with the registry office for the local authority district in which the person lived. If a person dies in hospital deaths, their death is registered with the district office in which the hospital is located. A death should be registered within five days of the death occurring, and upon the issue of a medical certificate detailing the cause or causes of death although registration can be delayed if the death has been reported to the coroner and an investigation or inquest is required.</p>
<p>These registration processes naturally take time and so NHS England, and now the Care Quality Commission, have begun reporting the number of deaths they have been notified as soon as it is practicably possible to support the response to Covid-19.</p>
<p>There are at least three sources of data for understanding the number of Covid-19 deaths. A summary of the key differences in the three sources is given in the table below.</p>

  <p class = 'side'>There are five provider trusts in the mortality dataset which largely serve residents in Sussex (Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust, Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust). As a general rule of thumb in planning and monitoring, half the patients in the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust are assigned to Surrey and half to Sussex. This is a crude assumption but if we take all deaths in the other four trusts and half of the deaths in Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, this is assumed to offer a good approximation of daily mortality in Sussex.</p>

<p id = 'latest_national_deaths_confirmed'></p>
<p>The national figures covering all settings are reported daily. However, to understand mortality at a local level using publicly available data we have to look at the individual settings and for deaths occurring outside of hospital, there is some time delay in reporting. There are more timely figures for hospital deaths, which are explored further down in the analysis, but these are reported at Acute Hospital Trust and this is not always coterminous with residential populations of local authorities.</p>

<p>The ONS has begun publishing weekly data at lower tier local authority for the number of deaths occurring in each week in the 2020 calendar year. From 31 March 2020 these figures also show the number of deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19), based on any mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate. These are aggregated to upper tier local authority for this analysis.</p>

<h4 style = 'padding-top: 10px'>Excess mortality and deaths not recorded as Covid-19</h4>
<p>It is important to remember that these Covid-19 deaths represent only those deaths where Covid-19 was confirmed or suspected as a cause of death. This is dependent on consistent and accurate recording of cause, which can be subjective for the doctors and officials completing certificates and there is thought to be variation in what is counted as a Covid-19 death locally, regionally and internationally.</p>
<p>There will also be deaths that occur as an <b>indirect</b> consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic (not the virus itself). A simple example is where an individual experiencing symptoms of a heart attack avoids seeking help or going to Accident & Emergency department due to a fear of getting the virus. There are many other examples of indirect causes of death including lack of nutrition as a result of not being able to access quality food or a person who would normally have a number of friends or family members to check their welfare suddenly being isolated and having fewer or no contacts with others.</p>
<p>Widely accepted as a superior measure of the true burden of the pandemic is to examine the excess deaths occurring in a population. This measures the additional deaths over a given time period compared to the number usually expected in a population (often a five year average). Such a measure would include those direct Covid-19 deaths that had not been diagnosed as well as indirect deaths.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics do not currently publish historical figures on weekly occurrences of deaths at a local level prior to 2020, so it is not possible to examine excess deaths at this time, but it is hoped that further data will be made available in the near future. Note that weekly death registrations data are available at national and regional level <a href = 'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales'>here</a> and registrations by month are available at local authority level <a href = 'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/monthlyfiguresondeathsregisteredbyareaofusualresidence'>here</a>, however these are not included in this analysis to avoid confusion between occurrences and registrations of deaths.</p>

<h4>Population mobility trends</h4>
<p>Google publish local reports on relative changes to movement trends over time across different categories of places (retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential locations).</p>
<p>The reports highlight the percentage change in visits to each type of place (see right hand side for more detail) although the residential category shows a change in duration of time spent there rather than a change in total visitors (which is not likely to change). Food shopping is separated from other retail locations as most non-food retailers have been closed for at least part of the lock down period. Visits to parks are likely to be partly dependent on the weather.</p>
<p>The figure below shows these changes in mobility in the local authority areas of the region. Choose a different area to change the figure.</p>
<p>The baseline (shown as the dashed line) is the median value of visits/duration, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020. This means that a Saturday is compared with the median value for Saturdays during January and the beginning of February. The datasets show trends from mid February to the last few days (there is some lag as it takes a few days to compile the data).</p>
