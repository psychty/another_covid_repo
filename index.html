  <h1>Coronavirus (Covid-19) local case summary - Sussex and the South East region</h1>
</div>

<div class="main" id = 'section_summary'>

<div class = "content">
<p>This analysis summarises the number of diagnosed coronavirus (Covid-19) cases recorded daily by Public Health England (PHE). This is primarily for the Sussex Local Authorities (Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, and West Sussex), but it also covers the 19 Upper Tier Local Authorities and Unitary Authorities in the South East region of England.</p>

<p>The first table and visualisation below shows the most recent recorded cases and the number of new cases by day. It is ordered by total number (cumulative) of cases to date with the highest number of confirmed cases at the top.</p>
<p>You can toggle between viewing the coloured squares as actual cases or as cases per 100,000 population. The areas across the South East have vast differences in population sizes. Bracknell Forest, the smallest area in terms of population, is estimated to be home for around 121,600 residents whilst Kent, the biggest population, is estimated to be home for almost 13 times Bracknell Forest's population with around 1,568,600 people estimated to live there. Given the differences in population, you might naturally expect there to be more cases in one area than another. Viewing the cases per 100,000 allows you to compare across areas as if they had the same population size.

  <p class = 'side'>In some cases, number of diagnosed cases can go down as a result of revision or validation.</p>
  <p class = 'side'>The colour key below has been chosen to capture the breadth of new cases across the region, whilst being sensitive to small numbers as well as periods of no reported cases.</p>

<div class = 'right-sidebar'>
  <p class = 'side'>This figure shows the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population over time. It allows you to compare different areas as if they had the same size population.</p>

<div class = 'content'>

</div>
<div class = 'right-sidebar'>
  <p class = 'side'>Much like the importance of considering actual cases and cases per 100,000, it is also important to view the data from both a linear and a logarithmic scale. <b>The data remains the same</b> however the logarithmic scale is more sensitive to changes in the rate of case increases.</p>
  <p class = 'side'>This would make it easier to highlight significant changes in trends.</p>
