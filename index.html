  <h1>Coronavirus (Covid-19) local confirmed case summary - Sussex and the South East region</h1>
</div>

<div class="main" id = 'section_summary'>

<div class = "content"  id = 'content_size'>
<p>This analysis summarises the number of diagnosed coronavirus (Covid-19) cases recorded daily by Public Health England (PHE) for Upper Tier Local Authority and Unitary Authority (UTLA) areas. This is primarily for the Sussex Local Authorities (Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, and West Sussex), but it also covers the 19 UTLAs in the South East region of England.</p>
<p>On 14th April, the way in which PHE share data on cases changed. Prior to the 14th April, data were presented daily on the number of confirmed cases reported to PHE on a particular day. As testing takes time, and particularly whilst capacity is being increased, there is some delay in returning results. For example, a patient having a swab taken on 1st April, with a positive result returned and reported to PHE on 5th April would be attributed to 5th April even though the patient was infected at least four days earlier.</p>

<p>From the 14th April, the new method of reporting shows confirmed cases by the date at which the specimin for testing was taken. The first positive specimen date is used and duplicate tests for the same patient are removed.</p>

<p>Whilst this method more accurately tracks the dates at which people are known to be infected, it may look like cases on the most recent days (which are still being reported daily) are sloping off (getting smaller). <b>This is not the case, it is simply that the most recent testing results may take several days to be reported.</b> PHE suggest that data for the most recent five days should be treated with caution and considered 'incomplete'.</p>

<p id = 'data_recency'></p>
<p id = 'unconfirmed_cases_count'></p>

<p>Prior to April 14th, the earliest reporting date was March 9th. In some areas, there were already cases, and in other areas there were none. Data are now back dated and revised such that every lab-confirmed case is attributed to the date at which the specimin was taken, which means the time series starts at different dates for different areas. The first specimins for a confirmed Covid-19 infection were taken on Janurary 30th 2020.</p>

  <p class = 'side'>This analysis has been created by Dr Rich Tyler and Ryan Walkley at the West Sussex Public Health and Social Research Unit.</p>
<p class = 'side'>These figures reflect the cases confirmed as a result of the testing strategy carried out at the time. At the start of the outbreak, the testing capacity was limited but it is increasing over time. The current (April) strategy has largely been to prioritise testing among those patients with suspected Covid-19 symptoms in intensive care units within hospitals, then in isolated cluster outbreak settings such as care homes as well as a small sample of general practices carrying out random testing for surveillance purposes (<a href = 'https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1222'>BMJ, 2020</a>). As capacity increases, more and more healthcare workers will be prioritised for testing in what has been termed 'Pillar 2' testing, which includes testing from commercial partners. Beyond this, the government is planning to expand diagnostics to antibody testing to confirm that a person has had the virus and is therefore likely to be immune from catching it again. See <a href = 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-testing-programmes/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-our-testing-programmes'>Government testing plans April 6th 2020</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The first table and visualisation below shows the most recently recorded confirmed cases and the number of new confirmed cases by day. It is ordered by total number (cumulative) of confirmed cases to date with the highest number of confirmed cases at the top.</p>
<p>The table also shows the most recent doubling times of confirmed cases over <u>five day periods</u>. Doubling time is the length of time it takes the total (cumulative) number of cases to double over the specified time period and the calculation often uses recent days or weeks (rather than looking across all the data points) to explore the current trajectory (accounting for recent interventions to slow the virus spread). <b>A longer doubling time indicates slower growth and a shorter doubling time indicates growth rate is increasing.</b> This concept is explored in more detail later in this analysis.</p>

<p>You can toggle between viewing the coloured tiles as actual confirmed cases or as confirmed cases per 100,000 population (crude, all age population as at 2018). The areas across the South East have vast differences in population sizes. Bracknell Forest, the smallest area in terms of population, is estimated to be home for around 121,600 residents whilst Kent, with the biggest population, is estimated to be home for almost 13 times Bracknell Forest's population with around 1,568,600 people estimated to live there. Given the differences in population, you might naturally expect there to be more cases in one area than another. Viewing the cases per 100,000 allows you to compare across areas as if they had the same population size.</p>
<p><font color = 'red'>The cumulative cases are taken from the most recently available date, although number of confirmed cases in a single day (a proxy for new cases) is taken from six days prior (latest complete date).</font></p>

<div class = 'right-sidebar'>
  <p class = 'side_important'>It is important to consider the testing strategy, capacity limitations, and any lag or delay in testing results, as outlined above, when interpreting cases as this can have an impact on the daily figures for local areas.</p>
  <p class = 'side_important'>A Surge in cases can in part be due to the amount of testing done locally from one day to the next.</p>
  <p class = 'side_important'>*In some areas, particularly with relatively low numbers of cases, there can be a large amount of fluctuation which can have an impact on doubling time.</p>

<p>The first line chart below shows the actual number of confirmed Covid-19 cases over time. You can choose which area to display using the drop down menu. Remember, the last five dots on this figure should be considered incomplete whilst specimins taken on these dates take time to be tested.</p>
<p>The dashed line represents the averege number of cases reported over the last three days. This goes some way in smoothing out fluctuation occuring daily as a result of delays or validation.

<p class = 'side'>Whilst comparing rates per 100,000 helps to standardise the total population size, it does not take into account different demographics of the populations in each area (e.g. the age and sex structure of a population). Data on the confirmed cases by age and sex, particularly at sub-national level, is currently unavailable. When and if these data become available, the figures will be updated to include age-sex standardised rates.</p>
<p class = 'side'>Population denominators are taken from the mid-year estimates for 2018 published by the <a href = 'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland'>Office for National Statistics</a>.</p>
<p class = 'side'>Rates are rounded to the nearest whole number (case). It should be noted that whilst cases are relatively low in some areas, rates may not be robust and in many cases may hover around zero for some time, although this does not necessarily mean zero cases.</p>

<h4>Cumulative cases over time from a different perspective</h4>
<div class = 'content'>
<p>So far, we have compared areas over time using counts and rates. These have shown vast differences across areas, and particularly highlighted that some local areas might be much further along their individual outbreaks than others. Indeed, we see that some areas such as Kent are recording their 2,000th confirmed case whilst the 50th case is being reported on the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>As some areas record their first few confirmed cases on different days, we have redrawn the x axis (along the bottom from left to right) on the next figure to count the number of days since case number 10. By doing this, you pull all of the trajectories to start at the same point on the figure and they can be compared with other areas on this basis. Starting on case number 10, rather than case number 1, means that the trajectories are a little more established and potentially showing transmission within an area as opposed to single cases coming into the area.</p>
<p>In addition, we have redrawn the y (vertical) axis to show the cumulative number of confirmed cases on a logarithmic scale (briefly explained on the right) to particularly highlight changes in growth (speeding up or slowing down) of infections. You can toggle between loglinear and linear scales to consider what each representation does to the data and trends.</p>
<p>The figure shows all of the South East region Local Authority areas on one figure (South East region and England have been excluded to make it easier to see each local area). You can hover over an area with you mouse pointer to find out more or choose an area from the drop down menu to highlight without hovering.</p>

<div class = 'right-sidebar'>
  <p class = 'side'>Much like the importance of considering both actual cases and cases per 100,000, it is also useful to view the data from both a linear and a logarithmic scale.</p>
  <p class = 'side'>The log scale also helps us to visualise exponential growth and doubling over time. A straight line with a steep slope indicates that the diagnosed cases will double in a short period of time whereas a line with a flatter slope suggests that the cases are not growing as quickly and will take much longer to double.</p>
<p class = 'side'><b>The data remains the same.</b> However, the logarithmic scale is more sensitive to changes in the rate of confirmed cases. This would make it easier to highlight significant changes in trends.</p>

<div class="main" id = 'loglinear_timeseries_plus_doubling'>
<div class = 'content'>
<p>The last figure for confirmed cases shows when we might expect the confirmed cases for a single area to double; given the most recent doubling time estimate (e.g. based on the most recent five days of complete data).</p>
<p>In this figure you can select an area to show the current trajectory, highlighting what the current trajectory means in terms of confirmed cases in the near future. You can also toggle between viewing the figure on a logarithmic scale (by default) or linear scale. Aggregated confirmed cases for Sussex areas combined, as well as South East region, and England can also be selected.</p>

<h4>Other measures of Covid-19</h4>
<p>The data presented so far has been based on confirmed cases of Covid-19. The confirmed cases are only a representation of the testing strategy and currently only show test results for patients in hospital as well as 'frontline' healthcare workers. <b>There will be many undiagnosed cases in the community (outside of hospital), in carehomes, and in other settings (such as prisons).</b></p>
<p>Until a robust community testing capability is realised, it is impossible to define the true spread of Covid-19. However, there are some other data sources and measures that can help to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>Symptom tracker applications such as the 'COVID Symptom Tracker' by researchers at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas' Hospitals, and ZOE Global ltd. This allows users to enter how they are physically feeling daily along with information on their sex, age, ethnicity, and first part of their postcode. Users can say if they are feeling well and have no symptoms or to indicate that they are symptomatic. Whilst much of this detailed data is not publicly available, it is possible to see at lower tier local authority level, the proportion of users who report at least some symptoms of the Covid-19 virus. In the UK (as at 18th April), there were 462,672 people aged 20-69 who reported currently having symptoms of the virus. Of course, not all those with symptoms will use the application, and the local figures do not include those under the age of 20 or over the age of 69.</p>
<p>Another source of information comes from the the NHS 111 symptom reporting pathways and 111 online. This shows, at the level of Clinical Commissioning Groups (which are largely coterminous with local authority boundaries through aggregation), the number of pathway triages and online assessments in which a user reports Covid-19 symptoms. Data include assessments by sex and broad age group (0-18, 19-69, and 70-120 years) of the user. There are many caveats around this, including that the data are not counts of people but rather assessments, people with symptoms might not use this or might use it multiple times over the course of their symptoms (and maybe not at the start of their symptoms). People are encouraged NOT to call NHS 111 to report Covid-19 symptoms unless they are worried but are asked to complete an NHS 111 online triage assessment. However, this data may give some indication of the symptom reporting locally.</p>
<p><font color = 'red'>Both the COVID Symptom Tracker, and NHS triage data, are for reporting of symptoms and they are not in anyway representative of confirmed cases of Covid-19.</font></p>
