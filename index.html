<h2 style = "padding-left: 25px;">What does this analysis tell us?</h2>
<div class = "content">
<p>This analysis summarises some of the published data on Coronavirus (Covid-19). It shows changes in confirmed cases over time as well as the mortality related to Covid-19.</p>
<p>This is primarily for the Sussex Local Authorities (Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, and West Sussex), but it also covers the 19 UTLAs in the South East region of England.</p>

<p>There are lots of stories to tell with the data, but it should be noted that<b> our understanding is evolving daily </b> as new information is received and as the data is revised. The box below shows a few important things to remember whilst exploring this analyses.</p>
<ul class='summary'>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>What we know about the spread of Covid-19 is a reflection of testing suspected cases.</li>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>Data on the death toll of Covid-19 comes from several different sources, each offering different perspectives as well as having different caveats. These should be considered carefully.</li>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>There are frequent changes to who are counted in statistics as well as changes in populations being tested for Covid-19 as capacity increases over time. Spikes in confirmed cases and deaths can be the result of virus spread as well as the way information is recorded.</li>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>Over time, new data will be added that will be more accurate and offer deeper understanding of the impact of Covid-19 on health and wellbeing.</li>
      <li class = 'list_summary'>As yet, there are no public data detailing the number of tests conducted at a local level.</li>

<h2 style = "padding-left: 25px;">Temporary notice</h2>
<div class = 'content'  id = 'content_size'>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, the volume of new information has increased exponentially with frequent changes to the data formats, as well as new caveats for understanding the data. Processing this information is becomming a task too difficult to maintain and this has largely been done in my own time.</p>
<p>I have had to prioritise work on a local version of this analysis (<ahref = 'https://wsx-c19-weekly-supplement.netlify.app'>https://wsx-c19-weekly-supplement.netlify.app</a>) which is updated every day as new data is released. The West Sussex version does contain some comparisons with other areas (including maps) but it is focused primarily on the districts and boroughs in the county only.</p>
<p>For the time being, I will not be updating this version, which showed West Sussex and other Local Authorities in the South East of England. There may be an opportunity in the future for me to catch up with the changes and present a view comparing areas. Many Local Authorities are now publishing their own weekly updates of the local pictures and these provide valuable interpretations of the data so I would recommend searching for your local authority webpages and sign up to alerts.</p>
