# Coronavirus (Covid-19) confirmed cases over time - Sussex and South East England.

This analysis summarises the number of diagnosed coronavirus (Covid-19) cases recorded daily by Public Health England (PHE) for Upper Tier Local Authority and Unitary Authority (UTLA) areas. This is primarily for the Sussex Local Authorities (Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, and West Sussex), but it also covers the 19 UTLAs in the South East region of England.

A heatmap and table crudely summarising recent changes in cases as well as time series analyses of cumulative cases, rates per 100,000 population and logarithmic plotting and doubling times illustrate the local picture of infection over time.

All code is open; including an R script 'tracking_new_cases.R' to compile and analyse new data, with data visualisation presented for web, using D3 javascript libraries. Some of it ~well~ annotated.  

As more data becomes available, more will be added to the data visualisation.
